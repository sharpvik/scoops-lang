# Documentation

Programming languages that manage to engage the general public become 
**much more successfull** than those that don't. It's a fact. One of the ways to
engage users and allow programmers to contribute with ease is to *document* your 
work.

Documentation also makes you state project's goals and standards clearly and in
no ambiguous terms (hopefully). Remember, programming language is, first of all,
a **set of rules**; rules must be recorded, otherwise they become mere *guides*.

**Implementation** is the part that requires hard work as well. How will you
physicly *create* that thing that you dare to *imagine*? To keep different
implementations in tact, there has to exist a standard -- an **ideal** -- that
dictates the trajectory of development.

This folder exists for all the reasons listed above. **Explore** if you wish to
understand.
