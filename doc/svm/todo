Goals of Scoops Virtual Machine and Bytecode

1. Execute code as fast as possible

2. But keep track of data used for debugging (like scoop and variable names)

3. Support raw or pre-compiled packages
    - Thus, be able to work with namespaces (e.g. math.floor)
    - Support bytecode that has packages pre-compiled and linked into it

4. Allow for unit tests to be run with ease

5. Provide simple interface between structs and functions written in Rust or Go
   (depending on the Scoops implementation) from within Scoops Language
