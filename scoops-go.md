# Scoops Execution Suite Implemented in Go

[Go] forces programmers to put their projects into a folder specified in a
special `$GOROOT` or `$GOPATH` environment variable, which makes it hard to
contain that project inside another, more global project, such as this one.

You can find `scoops-go` implementation by following [this link][scoops-go].
